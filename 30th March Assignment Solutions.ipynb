    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization methods. It aims to address the limitations of each by including both penalty terms in the regression equation. This allows it to handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection while preventing overfitting."
