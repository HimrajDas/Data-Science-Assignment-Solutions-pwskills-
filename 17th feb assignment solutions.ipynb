    "MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system. It falls under the category of non-relational databases and is designed to store, manage, and retrieve large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB uses a flexible document-based model, where data is stored in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.\n",

    "Non-relational databases: Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that don't adhere to the traditional relational model used in SQL databases. They are designed to handle vast amounts of unstructured or loosely structured data. NoSQL databases offer advantages like scalability, high performance, and flexible data models.\n",

    "Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). Each document can have a different structure, making it easy to handle evolving data schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally across multiple servers, distributing data and load to support growing datasets and user traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query Language: MongoDB supports rich queries, including field, range, and regular expression searches, making it versatile for various data retrieval needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing: MongoDB supports various types of indexes for efficient data retrieval, improving query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Aggregation: MongoDB provides aggregation pipelines, allowing users to perform complex data processing and transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Replication: MongoDB supports replica sets, ensuring high availability and data redundancy by maintaining multiple copies of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Sharding: MongoDB supports sharding, which allows data to be distributed across multiple servers to handle large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Ad hoc Queries: MongoDB allows for dynamic queries and supports both ad-hoc and predefined indexes."
