A while loop in Python is used to repeat a block of code as long as a given condition remains true. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition evaluates to True.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of while loop in Python:

    count = 0
        while count < 5:
        print(count)
        count += 1


The while loop is commonly used in situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand, and when you want to repeat a certain block of code until a certain condition is met. However, it's important to make sure that the condition eventually evaluates to False, otherwise the loop will run indefinitely, causing an infinite loop.
