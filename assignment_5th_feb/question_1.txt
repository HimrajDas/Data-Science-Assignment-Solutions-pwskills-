Class and object are the two main concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that objects created from the class will have. A class can be thought of as a category for objects that share similar characteristics and behaviors.

An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has attributes (data) and methods (functions) that can be manipulated. An object represents a specific occurrence of a class.

For example, consider a class "Person". The class can have attributes like name, age, and gender, and methods like speak, walk, and eat. An object of the class "Person" can be John Doe, who is 30 years old and male, and has the ability to speak, walk, and eat.

In short, a class defines the characteristics of a category of objects, and an object is a specific instance of that class.
