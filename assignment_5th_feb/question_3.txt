The main purpose of __init__() is to initialize the the object's attributes and states. It allows us to set the default values of our object's properties and prepare the object for use. The __init__() function also called as constructor. Example:-
    
    class Student:

        def __init__(self, name, id):
            self.name = name
            self.id = id

    student_1 = Student("Rahul", 103)
    student_2 = Student("David", 105)
